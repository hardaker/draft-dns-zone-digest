Abstract

   This document describes a protocol and DNS Resource Record used to
   provide a message digest over DNS zone data.  In particular, it
   describes how to compute, sign, represent, and use the message digest
   to validate the contents of a zone for accuracy and completeness.
   The ZONEMD Resource Record type is introduced for conveying the
   message digest data.

1.  Introduction

   In the DNS, a zone is the collection of authoritative resource
   records (RRs) sharing a common origin ([RFC7719]), which can be
   distributed from primary to secondary name servers.  Zones are often
   stored as files on disk in the so-called master file format
   [RFC1034].  Sometimes zones are distributed outside of the DNS, with
   such protocols as FTP, HTTP, rsync, and so on.  While zone files are
   self-contained, currently there is no way to validate the
   authenticity of a stand-alone zone file.

   This document introduces a new RR type that serves as a cryptographic
   message digest of the data in a zone file.  It allows a receiver of
   the zone file to validate its authenticity, especially when used in
   combination with DNSSEC.

   Message digests are also found in the TSIG protocol.  DNS transaction
   signatures (TSIG [RFC2845]) uses a message digest to protect
   individual query and response messages.  TSIG is generally used to
   authenticate and validate UPDATE and AXFR/IXFR messages.  However,
   TSIG's protections are ephemeral, existing only "on the wire," and
   are not retained after the transaction is complete.  Additionally,

Internet-Draft           dns-zone-message-digest              March 2018


   TSIG utilizes shared secret keys, which are not available to third
   parties.

   The technique described in this document makes the message digest a
   part of the zone file itself, and allows anyone to validate the zone
   file as a whole, no matter how it is transmitted.

   The zone message digest relies on DNSSEC to provide strong security
   guarantees.  Without DNSSEC, an attacker can modify zone data and
   recalculate the message digest and not be detected.  For discussion:
   currently this document does not require DNSSEC.  Should it be a
   prerequisite?

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  The ZONEMD Resource Record

   This section describes the ZONEMD Resource Record, including its
   fields, wire format, and presentation format.  The Type value for the
   ZONEMD RR is TBD.  The ZONEMD RR is class independent.  The RDATA of
   the resource record consists of three fields: Serial, Digest Type,
   and Digest.

   For discussion: This document is currently written as though a zone
   will only contain a single ZONEMD RR.  Having exactly one ZONEMD
   record per zone could simplify this protocol and eliminate confusion
   around downgrade attacks, at the expense of algorithm agility.

3.1.  ZONEMD RDATA Wire Format

   The ZONEMD RDATA wire format is encoded as follows:

                        1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                             Serial                            |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Digest Type  |                                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+             Digest                            +
   /                                                               /
   /                                                               /

3.1.1.  The Serial Field

   The Serial field is a 32-bit unsigned integer in network order.  It
   is equal to the serial number from the zone's SOA record ([RFC1035]
   section 3.3.13) for which the message digest was generated.

   For Discussion: the serial number is included in order to make DNS
   response messages of type ZONEMD meaningful.  Without the serial
   number, a stand-alone ZONEMD digest has no association to any
   particular zone file.  If ZONEMD were to be made a so-called meta
   type that cannot be queried for (like OPT), then serial would not be
   necessary.

3.1.2.  The Digest Type Field

   The Digest Type field is an 8-bit unsigned integer, with meaning
   equivalent to the Digest Type of the DS resource record, as defined
   in section 5.1.3 of [RFC4034].

   The status of ZONEMD digest types (e.g., mandatory, optional,
   deprecated) shall always match the status for DS records.  This
   information can be found in the IANA protocol registry for DS digest
   types [iana-ds-digest-types].

   At the time of this writing the following digest types are defined:

                +-----------------+-----------+-----------+
                | Description     | Status    | Reference |
                +-----------------+-----------+-----------+
                | SHA1            | Mandatory | [RFC3658] |
                | SHA256          | Mandatory | [RFC4509] |
                | GOST R 34.11-94 | Optional  | [RFC5933] |
                | SHA384          | Optional  | [RFC6605] |
                +-----------------+-----------+-----------+

                           Table 1: Digest Types

3.1.3.  The Digest Field

   The Digest field is a variable length sequence of octets containing
   the message digest.  Section 4 describes how to calculate the digest
   for a zone.

3.2.  ZONEMD Presentation Format

   The presentation format of the RDATA portion is as follows:

   The Serial field MUST be represented as an unsigned decimal integer.

Internet-Draft           dns-zone-message-digest              March 2018


   The Digest Type field MUST be represented as an unsigned decimal
   integer.

   The Digest MUST be represented as a sequence of case-insensitive
   hexadecimal digits.  Whitespace is allowed within the hexadecimal
   text.

3.3.  ZONEMD Example

   The following example shows a ZONEMD RR.

   example.com. 86400 IN ZONEMD 2018031500 4 ( FEBE3D4CE2EC2FFA4BA9
                                              9D46CD69D6D29711E552
                                              17057BEE7EB1A7B641A4
                                              7BA7FED2DD5B97AE499F
                                              AFA4F22C6BD647DE )

4.  Calculating the Digest

   Calculation of the zone digest requires the RRs in a zone to be in a
   consistent format and ordering.  Thus, digest calculation uses the
   canonical form and ordering of RRs as described in section 6 of
   [RFC4034].

   When calculating the zone digest, any existing ZONEMD records MUST
   first be deleted from the zone.

   Under the assumption that the zone will be signed with DNSSEC, a
   placeholder ZONEMD record MUST be added to the zone.  In the
   placeholder record, the Serial field MUST be set to the SOA Serial,
   the Digest Type field MUST be set to the value for the chosen digest
   algorithm, and the Digest field MUST be set to all zeroes and of
   length appropriate for the chosen algorithm.

   Next, the zone MAY be signed with DNSSEC.

   The zone digest is calculated by concatenating the canonical form of
   all records in the zone, in canonical order, including the ZONEMD
   placeholder, and including DNSSEC records if the zone is signed, and
   then applying the digest algorithm:

   digest = digest_algorithm( RR(1) | RR(2) | RR(3) | ... )

   where "|" denotes concatenation, and

   RR(i) = owner | type | class | TTL | RDATA length | RDATA





Wessels, et al.        Expires September 20, 2018               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft           dns-zone-message-digest              March 2018


   The calculated digest is then copied to the Digest field of the
   ZONEMD record.

   If the zone is signed with DNSSEC, the appropriate RRSIG records
   covering the ZONEMD record must then be added.  Because the ZONEMD
   placeholder was added prior to signing, the zone should already have
   the appropriate denial-of-existence (NSEC, NSEC3) records.

5.  Validating Zone Message Digest

   The recipient of a zone that has a message digest record can validate
   the zone by calculating the digest as described in Section 4.

   The following conditions must be true for a successful validation of
   the zone using the zone digest:

   1.  The SOA Serial field must exactly match the ZONEMD Serial field.

   2.  The calculated digest must exactly match the ZONEMD Digest field.

   3.  If the zone is signed with DNSSEC, the ZONEMD RRset must have a
       valid signature, chaining up to a trust anchor.

   For zones signed with DNSSEC, the denial-of-existence records can
   prove the existence or non-existence of the ZONEMD record in the
   zone.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The ZONEMD Digest Type field has the same semantics as the DS RR
   Digest Type field.  Thus, it does not add new IANA protocol registry
   requirements.

7.  Security Considerations

   For an unsigned zone, an attacker can trivially modify zone content
   and adjust the zone digest to match.

   DNSSEC provides stronger security guarantees, but only when a
   recipient knows to expect a signed zone.

8.  Privacy Considerations

   None.
